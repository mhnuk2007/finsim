# FinSim

**An open-source simulator for financial networks: connect independent services, run realistic payment flows, and break them on purpose.**

> **Status: pre-alpha.** FinSim is in its design phase. The architecture is documented; the code is being built milestone by milestone. This README only claims what exists. Everything else lives in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## What is FinSim?

Most payment sandboxes simulate one provider. FinSim simulates the *network*: independently built services (a bank, a merchant, a gateway) talk to each other through one versioned contract, and FinSim orchestrates the payment, injects failures, and shows you the full trace.

You write the institution, in any language. FinSim connects it, tests it, and shows what happened.

**Everything in FinSim is synthetic.** It never holds real money, never talks to real payment networks, and labels every simulated entity `SYNTHETIC`.

## Why?

Timeouts, duplicate requests, and uncertain outcomes are the hardest parts of payment engineering, and the parts most sandboxes hide. FinSim makes them reproducible:

- **`UNKNOWN` is a real outcome.** A timeout never turns into "failed". Retries are blocked until the outcome is resolved.
- **Idempotency is enforced.** Duplicate requests never create a second financial effect.
- **Fault injection.** Delays, timeouts, and duplicate deliveries on demand.
- **Full trace.** Every stage, call, and fault in one view.

## Status

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Design: architecture spec, requirements, contract sketch | Done (see `docs/`) |
| Build scaffold: Gradle modules, CI, module-boundary checks, CLI skeleton | Done |
| Database baseline: PostgreSQL + Flyway migrations, Testcontainers | Done |
| Transfer domain: aggregate root, state machine, append-only history | Done |
| Institution registry: registration, static sandbox network, seed data, CLI | Done |
| Sample bank (Java): in-memory bank implementing participant contract | Done (`samples/bank-java`) |
| Sample bank (Python): in-memory bank implementing participant contract | Done (`samples/bank-python`) |
| Payment orchestration & ADR 0001 resolution: debit/credit orchestration, `UNKNOWN` state handling, resolve endpoint | Done |
| Milestone 1: two sample banks, `finsim/v1` minimal contract, payment state machine with `UNKNOWN`, fault injection, `finsim trace`, `finsim verify` | In progress |
| Milestone 2: card authorize/capture/refund, virtual clock, ledger | Planned |
| Milestone 3: disputes, reconciliation, scenario replay | Planned |
| Clearing, RTGS, FX, screening, ISO 20022, billers, fees | Roadmap (help wanted) |

## Quickstart

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for the full step-by-step walkthrough.

### Try the running platform today

You can run PostgreSQL, the FinSim API, the Java/Python sample banks, and the CLI right now:

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL 17
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d

# 2. Start the FinSim API (port 8080)
./gradlew :finsim-api:bootRun

# 3. In separate terminals, start Bank A (port 9001) and Bank B (port 9002)
./gradlew :sample-bank-java:bootRun
./gradlew :sample-bank-java:bootRun --args="--spring.profiles.active=bank-b"

# (Optional: or run the Python sample bank on port 9003 in samples/bank-python)

# 4. Query seeded institutions and the sandbox network using the CLI (supports --json / -j)
./gradlew :finsim-cli:run --args="institutions"
./gradlew :finsim-cli:run --args="networks --id sandbox --json"
```

### Target payments experience (Milestone 1)

Transfer orchestration and fault injection commands will connect these components end to end:

```bash
# Execute payment across institutions
finsim transfer --network sandbox --from bank-a:ACC-1 --to bank-b:ACC-2 --amount 100.00 --currency USD
finsim trace <transactionId>

# Inject a timeout on bank-b and observe UNKNOWN state
finsim fault add --target bank-b --type TIMEOUT
finsim transfer ...        # ends in UNKNOWN, not FAILED
```

## Core concepts

- **Institution:** an independently owned service (bank, merchant, gateway) that implements the `finsim/v1` contract.
- **Network:** a controlled environment where registered institutions can transact.
- **Scheme:** the rules a network applies (currencies, limits, workflow).
- **Contract (`finsim/v1`):** the versioned HTTP/JSON API an institution implements. See [docs/contract-v1.md](docs/contract-v1.md) and [contract/finsim-v1.openapi.yaml](contract/finsim-v1.openapi.yaml).

## What FinSim is not

- Not a real-money system, payment network, or bank.
- Not connected to real sanctions lists, FX feeds, or regulators.
- Not a certification of conformance to any real payment scheme.
- Not a place where uploaded code runs inside the FinSim API process.
- Not safe to expose to the public internet: the platform and registry APIs have no authentication and are designed strictly for local simulation.

## Academic & Research Use

FinSim is built as a zero-liability, reproducible experimental laboratory for researchers, professors, and university students studying **Distributed Systems**, **Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI)**, **Chaos Engineering**, and **Payment Resilience**.

- **Cite FinSim in Academic Papers:** Scholars are welcome to cite FinSim in theses, conference papers, and technical reports. Use the **"Cite this repository"** button in GitHub's sidebar or see [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff).
- **University Coursework & Lab Projects:** Instructors in Computer Science, Fintech, or Software Engineering can use our ready-made semester lab modules, syllabi, and grading rubrics in the **[Academic & University Lab Guide](docs/academic-lab-guide.md)**.
- **Reproducible Benchmark Environments:** Because all entities are labeled `"provenance": "SYNTHETIC"`, peer reviewers can clone and reproduce chaos injection experiments in under 5 minutes without NDA or banking compliance barriers.
